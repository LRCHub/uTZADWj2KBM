Come with me into the trees
We'll lay on the grass
And let the hours pass
Take my hand, come back to the land
Let's get away
Just for one day

Let me see you stripped
Down to the bone
Let me see you stripped
Down to the bone

Metropolis has nothing on this
You're breathing in fumes
I taste when we kiss
Take my handCome back to the land
Where everything's ours
For a few hours

Let me see you stripped
Down to the bone
Let me see you stripped
Down to the bone

Let me hear you make decisions
Without your television
Let me hear you speaking
Just for me

Let me see you stripped
Down to the bone
(Let me hear you speaking, just for me)
Let me see you stripped
Down to the bone
(Let me hear you crying, just for me)

Let me see you stripped
Down to the bone
(Let me hear you speaking, just for me)
Let me see you stripped
Down to the bone
(Let me hear you crying, just for me)

Let me see you stripped
Down to the bone
(Let me hear you speaking, just for me)
