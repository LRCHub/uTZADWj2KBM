[00:31.90] When the revenant came down
[00:37.89] We couldn't imagine what it was
[00:46.62] In the spirit of three stars
[00:54.48] The alien thing that took its form
[01:03.06] Then to Lebanon, oh, God
[01:10.01] The flashing at night, the sirens grow and grow
[01:15.98] (Oh history involved itself)
[01:26.75] Mysterious shade that took its form (or what it was)
[01:35.89] Incarnation, three stars
[01:42.72] Delivering signs and dusting from their eyes
