The holy sword of fire is burning through the lands
Wizards and witches their torture never ends
Religious madness creates this hell on earth
Holy inquisition is spreading its curse
Murder, lies and slanders, they want to rule
Madmen and fools, they left a sea of running blood, running blood
Hundreds of pyres are burning in the night
Caluminated victims of inquisition's strike
Pray for the tortured, tears for their pain
Misanthropic blindness, a dog without a chain
Murder, lies and slanders, they want to rule
Madmen and fools, they left a sea of running blood, running blood
Running blood, running blood, they left a sea of running blood
